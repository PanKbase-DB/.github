# Welcome to PankBase

## Our Mission
PanKbase is a comprehensive, centralized resource for the study of the human pancreas and diabetes. The PanKbase collective aims to integrate diverse type 1 diabetes (T1D) datasets with expert-curated knowledge in a centralized, open-source data hub. Since users will ultimately be able to contribute their own data, this will be a repository for reproducible, collaborative research within the pancreas and T1D realms.

PanKbase plans to offer integrated and computation-ready genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, imaging, and physiological data. Datasets are currently sourced from key external programs, from which human donor-derived pancreatic data and metadata are aggregated, harmonized, and disseminated.
